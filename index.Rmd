<center><h1>Who Am I?</h1></center>

<div class = "row"><div class = "col-md-10">

<p style="text-align: justify; font-size: 1.1em;">I am an Electrical Engineer and I passionated in Data Science and Artificial Intelligence since I have started the very famous Data Science Specialization in Coursera. Sadly, I have interrupted my studies in 2016 to dive into a new area of work, running my own business. After an experience for two years as an entrepreneur, I decided to came back to my origins.

Now, as a Data Scientist, I am open to a new challenge in my life.</p>

      <p>In this Udacity's project I have performed a Data Wrangling and Data Visualization about the Medical Appointments from Vitória City, Brazil. The dataset is hosted in Kaggle and has almost 100,000 medical records. You can read my conclusion about it reading the nbviewer.</p>
